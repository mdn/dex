# In GitHub Actions, all the content of the .gitignore gets added to
# this file.
# If there's both a `.gitignore` *and* `.npmignore` file, and a file
# might mentioned in `.gitignore` but not in `.npmignore` it will be
# included.
# And we don't want to have maintain both. So right before it runs the
# `npm publish` step it will combine these two files.
